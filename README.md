## About

### Training
Adjust paths for data and weights as needed. Run training job (`train.py`) to either start from scratch or build upon previous trainings

### Testing
`test.py` can be used to test the model

### Weight Format
By default, weights are outputted in python pickle files. This can be converted to either json or onnx as needed; [random.kjonasj.com/digit-recognition/simple.html](random.kjonasj.com/digit-recognition/simple.html) uses the onnx format
