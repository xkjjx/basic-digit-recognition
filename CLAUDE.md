# Project Context for Claude Code

## Python Environment
- Use `uv` for running Python
- Run scripts as modules: `uv run python -m train.train_mlp`

## Workflow
- After adding a new feature, ask the user if they want the README updated
- When adding features common to both MLP and CNN training scripts, ask if it should also be added to train_and_test.py
- README updates must be concise; integrate into existing text rather than adding new sections
